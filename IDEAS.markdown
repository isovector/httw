- what is a computation? what's it's purpose?
  - to get some answer
  - how do we do it?
  - find a bigger, harder, less-specific problem
  - convince ourselves that if we can solve the general problem, we can solve
    our specific one
  - solve the general problem
  - in this way, we need to determine what are the essential pieces of the
    problem, and determine which parts we can safely ignore
  - we would like the solution to be simple and concise, because we are
    intellectually modest and must realize that our brains are not well
    optimized for most sorts of tasks we throw at them
  - especially things like solemn study or engineering. we get bored easily. we
    can only keep a few things in working memory at a time.
  - in fact, the only technique we seem to have that actually works is to break
    big problems into smaller problems, solve them and then recombine the
    solutions into a bigger solution
      - this is called composiiton
      - and you can do it recursively
      - keep going until each individual problem is so simple that it's trivial
        to solve
  - we must also be aware that we are prone to fool ourselves.
  - often the task at hand is in service of another, and thus we dream of the
    status of doing a good job at it, which is much more compelling than
    actually DOING a good job
  - furthermore, human thought is particularly sloppy. millennia of philosophers
    have been doing their utmost to clearly define ideas, and yet somehow the
    field is not yet solved. perhaps these are uniquely hard problems, or
    perhaps ideas are not nearly as crisp as we'd like to pretend
  - this sets the stage for computation. computation is an exploration of
    phenomena.
  - much like telescopes and microscopes and night vision goggles
    - not TRUE. the computer is this.
  - but computation is not related to computers. computers are very specific
    tools for automatically doing computation
  - so anyway, we would like simple solutions to problems because it's the only
    chance we have of not fooling ourselves
- why do we care?
  - computation rules the world.
  - software is a special case; which runs all of the world's banks, cars, and
    logistics systems
  - if for no other reason, it's worth understanding what computation is, just
    in order to get a sense of how the modern world works, and what it's built
    out of
  - however, computation is more general than software
  - computation is a slushing-about of information, that preserves truth. it's
    a transformation of information in one shape into information in another
  - it's goal driven; that is, we are LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER and computation
    allows us to get it
  - it's the clever extraction of an answer from a question
  - deliberate process that transforms inputs into outputs, pertaining in some
    sense to the mental domain.
  - in the modern world, computation often means "we have a desired goal, figure
    out a way of getting it."
      - that might mean a financial model
      - or the weather forecast
  - the computationalist is then tasked with the problem to determine how to
    produce that goal. it is often a measure of working backwards; understanding
    the goal so well that one can reverse-engineer the necessary inputs and
    transformations of such that lead to the desired outcome
  - the purpose of the computationalist is to determine the means by which the
    outcome can be generated. the purpose of computation is to actually generate
    that outcome.
  - to understand a problem so well as to know the answer can be no other way.
  - computation is a raw force of nature; the universe is doing it all the time,
    everywhere. the universe is computing where all of the atoms should be in
    the next picosecond.
      - this is the only source of computation.
      - we humans are just clever enough to build a system of canals to channel
        the necessary computation towards our ends
          - that might be in the form of an ELECTRONIC COMPUTER
          - or it might just be in our minds
          - this is why most people hate math
          - compare COMPOSING MUSIC to PRESSING PLAY ON A RECORDING
            - once it's been designed (and recorded), the recording can't help
              but to go in exactly the way it's been laid down.
          - they have been taught how to compute, without having been taught how
            to think
              - children are taught how to compute (5 * 8) + 4 and then asked to
                run the maze
                  > just told to memorize a bunch of rules and a bunch of tables
                  > precomputed! trust us, and then do the mechanical work
              - but there is nothing interesting here; the rules are already in
                place, and the question is are you enough of an automaton to
                correctly implement those rules
              - WHAT A WASTE OF HUMAN TALENT
              - humans are not meant to be automatons. leave the menial,
                thoughtless work to machines, and let us focus on creative
                tasks!
          - when people say they are mathematicians, this is not what they mean.
      - we set up a series of conventions, such that if an electron zigs left,
        that means YES, and if it zags right, it means NO
      - exactly in the same way we english speakers collectively acknowlege that
        ink molecules on a piece of paper in the shape of YES means yes
      - there is a special correspondence between the symbols we write on the
        page and the ideas we hold in our mind, such that the two are
        INTERCHANGEABLE and thus nearly invisible
          - we don't think "ah yes, there is a series of reflected photons
            bouncing off of some object and exciting the cones in my retina,
            which give the shape of a cup of coffee in front of me", we just
            think "ah, there is my coffee"
          - the machinery is so flawless that it's effectively invisible to us


- what is a transformation?
- the remainder of the book is about clever ways of constructing spaces and
  transformations over them
- but also philosophy
  - why does mathematics work?
  - complexity theory and what it can tell us about philo
  - np-hard problems don't seem to be solvable by the universe
