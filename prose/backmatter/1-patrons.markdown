## Acknowledgements {-}

Writing a book is a serious investment of time and energy, and this one couldn't
have happened without the support of many, many fantastic people. I want to
thank everyone for their support, their patronage, and their enthusiasm.  Some of
the exceptionally instrumental people, however, require further accolades. In
particular:

*Reed Mullanix,* for tirelessly and enthusiastically helping me work through the
many, many mathematical difficulties I came across while researching this book.

*Barry Moore,* for spending so many of his weekend hours beta-testing every chapter and each of their revisions. I'm genuinely sorry for just
how many "part twos" I put you through.

*Jonathan Lorimer,* for his unending enthusiasm and our many late-night strategy
sessions trying to whip tricky chapters into shape.

*Louisa Edelmann,* for playfully teasing that writing only a single book doesn't
really warrant calling oneself a writer. Without you, this project probably
would have never happened.

*Kenneth Bruskiewicz,* for telling me what I needed to hear --- even though I
didn't want to listen.

Intellectually, this book stands on the shoulders of Conal Elliott and John
Hughes, whose ideas will forever continue to inspire me.

Thanks to Nick Smallbone for all of his hard work on QuickSpec, and for being so
patient with the deluge of issues and questions I sent his way.

Furthermore, this book wouldn't have been possible without the generous
financial support of Bob Ippolito, codygman, Adam Conner-Sax, Gabriele Lana, Daniel
Tebbutt, Jan Hrček, Vladimir Ciobanu, Samuel Evans-Powell, Edmund Cape, Pavlos
Pantatakis, Fintan Halpenny, Jonathan Lorimer, Alexey Nesterov, Jakub
Zarybnicky, Imre Gulyas, Andor Penzes, Shane Sveller, Reynaldo Cordero, Sam
Raker, Andrei Orlov, Henry Laxen, Michael Alan Dorman, David Burkett, Michael
Hood, Barry Moore, Markus Läll, Adnaan Mukadam, pluton, Daniel Gasienica, Andre
Moelle, Adam Flott, Martin Allard, Patrick Weemeeuw, Joel McCracken, Ian, Chris
Penner, Forest Walk, Dawid Furman, Angel Vanegas, Christian Lavoie, Alexander
Granin, Csongor Kiss, and Sergey Kintsel.
